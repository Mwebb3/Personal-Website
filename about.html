                        I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas where I continue to reside.
                        I have two older sisters who never let me forget I am the baby of the family.

                        I graduated from Baylor University in 2022 with a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing.
                        After graduating, I worked as an operating room nurse for over a year when I decided to make the switch to informatic technology.
                        I am currently attending Depaul University to receive a Master's of Science in Health Informatics by 2025.
                    </p>

                        I am excited to make this career change a dream come true!
